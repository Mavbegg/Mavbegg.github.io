Agroforestry has the potential to combine agricultural productivity, food and bioenergy production with environmental benefits such as carbon sequestration. Soil and biomass carbon data from Scots Pine, Sycamore and Hybrid Larch silvopastoral systems in Northeast Scotland will be used to discuss how efficiently these systems can sequester carbon in the long term. The silvopastoral systems will be compared to pure pasture and woodland stands, both of which are competing land uses. Empirical soil carbon data is available on a total carbon in tonnes per hectare basis and additionally from a soil fractionation study. The fractionation allows for assessment of longer term carbon stability in the soil. Additionally, soil carbon changes have been assessed using a modelling approach and the model was compared to empirical data. Biomass carbon was estimated using allometric equations based on diameter at breast height (DBH) data. Both the practicality of agroforestry systems as a land management approach with particular focus on carbon sequestration and the reliability of the field, laboratory and modelling methods used can be discussed.
