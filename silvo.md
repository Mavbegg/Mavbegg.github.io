# Introduction
Quantifying carbon stocks and understanding the ability of different land use systems to sequester carbon is crucial for sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Silvopastoral systems can potentially store more carbon than forest and pasture ecosystems. This was tested by quantifying above and belowground tree carbon using allometric equations, litter layer and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the A horizon (0-30cm) and B horizon (30-50 cm) in a Hybrid Larch (Larix eurolepis) and Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) silvopasoral system in Northeast Scotland in comparison with woodland plots and pure pasture.
